//using System.ComponentModel;

//1)
//The “Driver” class (the Program.cs class with the main method where the program begins) will:
//• Welcome the user to the game
//• Create a game board array to store the players’ choices
//• Ask each player in turn for their choice and update the game board array
//• Print the board by calling the method in the supporting class
//• Check for a winner by calling the method in the supporting class, and notify the players when a win has occurred and which player won the game

//2)
//The supporting class (with whichever name you choose) will:
//• Receive the “board” array from the driver class
//• Contain a method that prints the board based on the information passed to it
//	- display 3x3 with underscores, X's, & O's
//• Contain a method that receives the game board array as input and returns if there is a winner and who it was
//	- check for a win

//public void PrintBoard(array gameboard)

//public bool CheckWin(array gamboard)
